This is a decision tree implementation in C++ for binary decisions. Currently it supports all numeric attributes. 

How to Compile ?
g++ main.cpp BdTreeLib/BdTree.h  BdTreeLib/BdTree.cpp BdTreeLib/BdTreeSample.h

Only main.cpp needs to be changed to try different inputs

Pending : code for prediction is not written. Tree is made and it is just a walk through the tree to get the class
